Menu driven program which can do the following- 

a) Insertion at a position in the array
b) Insertion at beginning
c) Insertion at end
d) Delete by position
e) Delete by element (first occurrence of element)
  // I used 2 dynamic arrays to do this (arr and res). Run linear search algorithm on the original array (ie arr).          
     4 possible cases - 
            i) First element of the array (ie arr[0])
                      - copy the array from arr[1] to arr[len-1] to the other array (ie res) and print res array.
            ii) Last element of the array (ie arr[len-1])          
                      - copy the array from arr[0] to arr[len-2] to the other array (ie res) and print res array.
            iii) Any other 
                     - split the array into 2 parts- arr[0] to arr[i-1] and arr[i+1] to arr[len-1]
                     - copy these subarrays to res array.
                                  for elements in arr[0] to arr[i-1], res[i] = array[i];
                                  for elements in arr[i+1] to arr[len-1], res[i-1] = arr[i];
                     - print res array.
f) Search by position
g) Search by element (present or not)
h) Revert the array (in place)
