# miniproject
# This hospital management system project was created in collaboration with a fellow student from my lecture.
# It's a basic model that includes nested loops, modules and file handling (file creation, searching, appending and deletion).
# We used Source Tree by Atlassian to manage the Gitflow workflow.
